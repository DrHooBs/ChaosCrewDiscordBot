- Replace all rolnd guild id's with the ones from the Kennevo's Server (what_day.py, dead_members.py, baned_words.py and more) (once invited to Kennevos chaos crew)



make one json file for all the user information:
    {
    "54232345234623632":{
        "jobs":0,
        "birthday":"1970-01-01",
        "incidents":0
    },
    "234535425342543253424":{
        "jobs":0,
        "birthday":"1970-01-01",
        "incidents":0
    }
    }
