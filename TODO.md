- Replace all role and guild id's with the ones from the Kennevo's Server (Kennevo's Chaos Crew)
- Make one json file for all the user information. Example:
```json
{
    "54232345234623632":{
        "jobs":0,
        "birthday":"1970-01-01",
        "incidents":0
    },
    "23453542534254424":{
        "jobs":0,
        "birthday":"1970-01-01",
        "incidents":0
    }
}
```
