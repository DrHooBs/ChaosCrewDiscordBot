replace all role, and guild id's (what_day.py, dead_members.py, new_member.py, baned_words.py, userinfo.py, twitch.py and more) (once invited to Kennevo chaos crew)


make one json file for all the user information:
    {
    "54232345234623632":{
        "jobs":0,
        "birthday":"1970-01-01",
        "incidents":0
    },
    "234535425342543253424":{
        "jobs":0,
        "birthday":"1970-01-01",
        "incidents":0
    }
    }

a clean repository is always nice

update readme to include what DAVE can do

update dependencies

(role and userids), make them change depending on what server.

MOST IMPORTANT:

    Get Harry continue contributing!!!!
